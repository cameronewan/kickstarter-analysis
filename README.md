# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns.
## Overview of Project
### Purpose

The purpose of our analysis was to determine how Louise’s play Fever compared to other plays with fundraising goals. She wanted us to compare the success rate of the other plays in relation to launch date and fundraising goals. Louise was interested in seeing how her play stacked up to the rest of them. I will provide both a written and visual analysis for Louise. 

## Analysis and Challenges

It is often easiest to understand data when it is visually represented in a graph or chart so we created a few of each type. I created both a pivot table and a line graph for both data sets that we were analyzing. (insert charts) The reason that we made the pivot tables is that we were not interested in all the data that we had available to us, we were only interested in some of the data. Pivot tables are a great way to filter data so that you only see what in necessary, which in turn allows us to make charts out of that data which further our analysis even more. The biggest challenges that I encountered were making sure that the functions I was using in excel were correct and were not going to give me any errors. I also had to make sure my symbols such as >/>=/<= were all correct otherwise my results might come back with incorrect data.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
-	The most clear and obvious conclusion that we can draw from the Outcomes based on Launch Data is that there were more successful theater startups than there were failed ones by a somewhat significant number (839->493).but something interesting to note is that the line graphs follow a very similar pattern. What we can conclude from this is that there are months when more people are looking to launch their theater productions such as in May and June and less in December and January. While there were many successful launches in May and June there were also a lot of failed launches. What this could mean is that these months are a good time to start a production because people are going out more to the theater because it is nice outside, however that also means more competition between the productions which results in more failing as well. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
-	The first thing that immediately jumps out at you when looking at the Outcomes based on Goals data is that when the goal is greater than or equal to 45,000 almost all failed ranging from 87.50%-100%. What this tells us is that if your goal is larger than 45,000 your play will more than likely fail to reach its goal. On the other hand if your goal is in the range of 1,000-49,999 then you have over a 50% chance that your play will be successful. No play fundraising goals were cancelled. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
-	One limitation is the size of the data pool, we might get a better understanding if we look at all the crowd funding websites and not just kickstarter. It is possible that kickstarter is not a good place for theater or plays and a site like gofundme or indiegogo is better for that kind of startup. The more data we have the better our analysis will be. Another possible limitation is that just because the goal wasn’t met on the website does not mean that the play wasn’t produced because people might ask for more money than they need in the hope of reaching their bottom line. If they did not reach their goal our results would read failed, but it is possible they made enough money to still produce it. 
### Other Potential Results
-	We could create a graph or table that compares all the data of the plays and theater productions in direct relation to Louise’s play this way we could see Cleary how Louise stacks up to the other plays. We could do it in terms of goal or how long the kickstarter was up for because reaching its goal. We could even compare the number of backers. We could also compare between countries to see in which country the play and theater kickstarters had more success. And finally, we can of course compare data other than plays and theater because there are many subcategories that we did not explore.
