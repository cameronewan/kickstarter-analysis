# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns.
## Overview of Project
### Purpose

The purpose of our analysis was to determine how Louiseâ€™s play Fever compared to other plays with fundraising goals. She wanted us to compare the success rate of the other plays in relation to launch date and fundraising goals. Louise was interested in seeing how her play stacked up to the rest of them. I will provide both a written and visual analysis for Louise. 

## Analysis and Challenges

It is often easiest to understand data when it is visually represented in a graph or chart so we created a few of each type. I created both a pivot table and a line graph for both data sets that we were analyzing. (insert charts) The reason that we made the pivot tables is that we were not interested in all the data that we had available to us, we were only interested in some of the data. Pivot tables are a great way to filter data so that you only see what in necessary, which in turn allows us to make charts out of that data which further our analysis even more. The biggest challenges that I encountered were making sure that the functions I was using in excel were correct and were not going to give me any errors. I also had to make sure my symbols such as >/>=/<= were all correct otherwise my results might come back with incorrect data.
